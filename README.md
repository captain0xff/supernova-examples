# Supernova Examples
Examples for supernova game engine.


## Building
Clone the repository and run
```
cd examples
cmake .
make
```


## Clean up
As the project uses the src directories for buidling. Things can look and get messy. Run the clean.sh to cleanup the untracted files. Remember to commit any changes before running this as those changes may also get removed.

## Known Issues
* Assets won't be found if cmake is invoked from any other directory except examples.
