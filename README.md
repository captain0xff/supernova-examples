## Building
Clone the repository and run
```
cmake .
make
```


## Clean up
As the project uses the source directories for buidling things can look and get messy real quick. Run the clean.sh to cleanup the untracted files. Remember to commit any changes before running this as those changes may also get removed.

## Known Issues
* Assets won't be found if cmake is invoked from any other directory except the project root.
